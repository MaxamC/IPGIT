	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>American Sniper</u></h1>
		 <p>“American Sniper” is one hell of a movie, let’s just start there. Starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller and directed by Clint Eastwood, this movie has the star power to bring people to theater and it has done just that, winning the box office two weekends in a row. Luckily, “American Sniper” is more than pretty faces, it’s a story about the making of a warrior and the life that he led. With a strong script, talented actors and a director that had a clear vision it is my leader for Best Picture this year (be on the lookout for reviews for “Boyhood” and “Birdman” who are also vying that top position).</P>
        <br/>

		 <div class="ileft">
		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>It’s hard to box “American Sniper” into one category as it splits it’s time between an action film and a family drama. It is just this dichotomy that makes the film as strong as it is, adding a layer to each story that made it more dramatic and important to the audience. While the film deals mostly with the military life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) and his career as a sniper, it also tells the story of his family and his struggle to keep that part of his life alive and well as he deals with life away from war. It’s this dual-focus that makes “American Sniper” more than a film about an United States soldier, it makes it an Oscar contender, and in my option, the leading option for Best Picture.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>There isn’t a weak performance in the entire movie, and I mean I didn’t catch one false note from anyone; still, Bradley Cooper stood tall above the rest. Disappearing into the fifty-plus pounds of muscle that he added for the role, Cooper is not the smiling, wise-cracking, pretty boy everyone loved in “The Hangover” (2009). The fact that he can act is a surprise to no one anymore, after “Silver Linings Playbook” (2012) and “American Hustle” (2013) both earned him Oscar noms, he’s quickly become one of the brightest stars in Hollywood. In “American Sniper” he makes a transition into a role that I hand’t seen from Cooper before. Usually smart and snappy, his portrayal of Chris Kyle is quiet, strong and contemplative without being brooding or demonstrative. Another fold in his performance is the dual nature of the film - set half at home with his family, and half at war with his team, Cooper plays both the warrior and the civilian with dexterity and grace; he’s truly a delight to watch.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Look out for the sunglasses. Cooper uses his glasses as a physical representation of his “warrior” mindset. When you watch the film, watch for the moments that the character has them on, has them off, and most importantly when he slides them off his head and onto his eyes - it is equivalent of smearing on eyeblack before a big game. These glasses seem to bring with them the armor that Cooper wears while he is deployed, armor that he has trouble taking off when he gets back to his family. From a filmmaking point of view, they’re a small tool, but they’re used in such a pointed way that their power is grand.</P>
