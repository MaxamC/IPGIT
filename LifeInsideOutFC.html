	  <h4 style="text-align:center;">*Indy Film of the Month*</h1>

		 <p>With 13 festival wins under its belt already, I’m far from the first person to say that 
“Life Inside Out” is a success. In her directorial debut Jill D’Agnenica delivers a tight, 
honest, accessible film that tells a small story in a huge way. With poignant takes on 
family, love, and relationships, this drama has a little something for everyone and 
great music to boot. It’s a film for mothers, sons, sisters, husbands, families, and 
musicians. It’s a film for anyone who has ever put something down and wanted to 
pick it back up. It’s a film for people that believe in healing through love. Honestly, 
it’s a movie for everyone.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>The strength of this film lies in its ability to simultaneously adhere to the roadmap
of the genre, and then spontaneously buck that stereotype and create genuine, 
honest moments. It is a family drama, through and through, but a family drama that 
reflects a real family, not the polarizing perfect or horrible families we’re so used to 
seeing. Writers Maggie Baird (who also stars in the film) and Lori Nasso (who also 
appears on screen and almost steals the show) forge a story and more importantly, a 
group of relationships that are not only believable but relatable. Time and again, I 
was surprised at how these writers were able to take a familiar Hollywood scene 
and flip it on its ear by injecting honesty into it. Look for “Life Inside Out” to be like 
other family dramas, just better.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>Firstly, this is a strong ensemble cast, and each performance seems to be tied to the 
one next to it. That being said, David Cowgill (who plays the husband and father) 
stood out for me. Like all great performances, a lot does come from the script, and 
the writers crafted a complex, human character that Cowgill brings to life 
beautifully. Most of the moments that I found delightfully surprising involved his 
character, a father who is a real, complex man. Cowgill has the wherewithal to not 
play every scene in the same note, he moves from stressed to angry to sad to 
understanding to loving and back again. He creates a human being, and watching 
someone act that way is inspiring.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>This film is full of successes: from the performances that I mentioned earlier to the
direction and the cinematography (cinematographer Guido Frenzel creates a 
personal feel throughout), but it was the script that blew me away. Maggie Baird and 
Lori Nasso not only have the guts to buck the hallmarks of family drama, but the 
talent to personalize instead of stereotype. This isn’t a big story, and by that I mean 
there isn’t a hole in the sky where aliens are coming in, there’s no countdown to 
doomsday. There is a mother cleaning dishes and her sons adding more without 
noticing, there is a son who gets into the car without wearing headphones. 
Seemingly innocuous moments like these ones (the moments of our lives) are the 
emotional meat of this film, and they’re crafted in such a personal way that “Life 
Inside Out” is understandable, relatable and accessible for the audience. The 
ultimate success of this film comes from its ability to tell a small, human story, and 
do it in a way that matters to those who watch it.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Look for honesty in this film. Look for truths that we know exist in real life and
somehow never make it to the silver screen. “Life Inside Out” has the guts to present 
small, honest portrayals of relationships and problems and in doing so, invites the 
audience to join in on a much more personal level. Be it the relationship between 
sisters, or a troubled marriage, or children that take their mother for granted, there 
is no pomp and circumstance surrounding it all. Without the Hollywood hallmarks 
(the cheating spouse, the secret life) “Life Inside Out” surprised the audience again 
and again by crafting scenes that are familiar not because we’ve seen them before, 
but because we’ve lived them.</P>
