	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Selma</u></h1>
		 <p>There’s been a lot of talk around “Selma” and the nominations that it did (and more importantly did not) get from the Academy. The film, which follows the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) as he leads the fight for the right of African Americans to vote; is the most honest recreation of the Civil Rights era that I have ever seen. Director Ava DuVernay didn’t shy away from the reality of the situation, often showing violence that was hard for me to watch, giving the film a weight and a no-nonsense approach that I found captivating. “Selma” was been nominated for Best Picture but has been snubbed in both the Best Director and Best Actor categories (Common and John Legend have also been nominated for Best Original Song). It’s a beautiful film that comes out at a time when our nation is revisiting racial prejudice issues and “Selma” does a wonderful job at showing the virtue of the non-violent movement, and the hardships that were endured for basic civil rights.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>Questions of reality in filmmaking have been circling the cinemas this year. With “American Sniper” and “Selma” both focused around true stories of American heroes, there has been backlash regarding the factualness of the films. “Selma”, which does a wonderful job at exploring the reality of the horrors of a segregated South, glazes over the personal problems that Dr. King was experiencing during the time. Instead choosing to focus her film on the activities and actions happening in and around the protest in Selma, Ava DuVernay touched briefly on Dr. King’s less saintly attributes, but they were never explored fully. Lying by omission is real, but I’m not of the mind that it applies to filmmakers. “Selma” is a powerful film about one of our nation’s finest moments, but those looking for a Martin Luther King Jr. biopic are going to be disappointed.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>In a film full of familiar faces and strong performances, it was Oprah who I couldn’t take my eyes off of. She plays a minor role in the film (onscreen that is, Mrs. Winfrey produced the film), but while she is onscreen it’s impossible to look anywhere else. With stoicism and nobility, Oprah opens the film trying to register to vote in the segregated city of Selma. The scene, which sets the stage for the action of the film, also sets the tone. Oprah is powerful and defiant as she tries unsuccessfully to jump through the hoops that the registrar places in front of her, finally barring her from registering. Those same glowing embers of empowerment are present as we see Oprah in later scenes, marching with Dr. King and standing up for rights which should never have been denied to begin with. Before seeing the film, I was curious to see how the supernova that is Oprah Winfrey would fit into a supporting role - well I’m here to say that I will never doubt Oprah again, she can be as big or as small as she wants. In fact, she’s the lone actor in “Selma” that I would have given an Oscar Nomination to.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>The “feel” of the 1965 was brought forth most successfully, as is common with period pieces, through the costume department. Ruth E. Carter has worked in this area before, being nominated for the 1993 film, “X” starring Denzel Washington, and in “Selma”, the feel of the film was heavily relying on Ms. Carter’s ability to bring the audience to that time and place. There is no flash, no need to make the actors look sexy - instead, the costumes disappear into the tapestry of a segregated South that was created so successfully in the film.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>One thing that I couldn’t avoid while watching “Selma” was the overwhelming presence of British actors playing American roles. Maybe it’s untoward to bring up nationality when talking about a film that champions equal rights, and I want to say now, clearly, that I have no problem with any of the actors that are British that appeared in the film; many of them did powerful work, and most of them I have been fans of for years. Still, four of the major roles in the film: Dr. King, Coretta Scott King, President Johnson and Governor Wallace, are all played by Brits. Acting is just that, acting - I believe that a talented actor can portray a character from any nation, and any walk of life. I just would have loved to see an American play the role of one of our greatest citizens. The same as it would be strange to have an American be tapped to play James Bond, I was left hoping that at least ONE of the key roles in a deeply patriotic film such as this be played by a citizen of the United States.</P>
