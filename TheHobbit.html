	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</u></h1>
		 <p>“The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies” marks the end of the Peter Jackson/JRR 
		 Tolkien era, and Jackson tries to make the film into a real grand finale — by that I mean 
		 that he opens with a dragon being slain and builds from there. This film is essentially
		 two and a half hours of fighting, and for good reason, it's a movie dedicated to the final
		 act of a novel, the final battle, the big finish. While that might sound like a perfect 
		 film for some of you, it was the ultimate undoing of this film, leaving most of the audience 
		 (including yours truly) wondering who characters were, where characters were, and why everyone 
		 was so angry with one another —all the reasons for this battle were explained in films that 
		 came out in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Even without a clear cause, the effect was still a 
		 lot of fun to watch. Beautiful CGI, Jackson’s famous attention to detail, and a strong cast 
		 make sure this is a far cry from “Expendables 4: Middle Earth”, but I was hoping for a little
		 more context and a little less sword swinging.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>If you’re feeling skittish because of previous Peter Jackson films with talking trees 
		 and forty minute scenes where an elf argues with a dwarf — have no fear, “Battle Of The Five Armies” 
		 is not that film. It’s more like someone saw the final battle scene from “Lord of the Rings: Return 
		 of the King” and said, “I just wanna watch two whole hours of that.” The idea to make “The Hobbit” 
		 into three movies was questioned at the outset (it’s just one book, as opposed to LOTR which 
		 is a trilogy, like the films), and I think having so little dramatic build-up in the last act 
		 was the downfall of the film. For fans of the series, it’s going to feel and look the way you 
		 want it to, Peter Jackson has perfected the style, but this installment will stand stronger with 
		 the group than it does on it’s own.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>By breaking “The Hobbit” into three films, Peter Jackson felt he would be able to give 
		 the story the attention that it deserves. While this format payed off for the first two 
		 films (and for the series as a whole), it means that “The Battle Of The Five Armies” was 
		 essentially only a battle. While that does make for quite an exciting film (or at least 
		 an action-packed one), it also makes for a film in which actors are going to have a hard 
		 time delivering memorable performances simply because of the lack of time to do so. It 
		 wasn’t that the actors put forward bad performances, just that there wasn’t much in the 
		 script for them in the first place. I talk about performance a little more in my “What To Watch For” 
		 section, but I do want to mention that Cate Blanchett is in the movie for about five minutes, 
		 and she blew me outta the theater with the curse she puts on Sauron.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>I believe I’ve written a sentence or two about the fact that “The Battle Of The Five Armies” 
		 is mostly one huge, epic battle between a certain number of armies (the official count is a mystery). 
		 Now it’s time for me to say this: the battle is SO well done. Peter Jackson and his team are at the 
		 forefront of splicing CGI with live action, often having live actors riding computer generated 
		 steads into battle, and making it look AWESOME. One shot in particular of a billy goat carrying 
		 it’s dwarf rider up the almost perfectly vertical side of a mountain was of the most exciting 
		 I’ve seen on a screen in a long time. Peter Jackson’s famous eye for detail means that each army 
		 looks unique and fight in unique ways. The audience is constantly bouncing from one front to another 
		 and while I felt this constant stimulus made it impossible for the actors to deliver powerful performances, 
		 it also kept me interested in the action the whole time. Yes, it’s a movie that is entirely about one 
		 battle, but the filmmakers make sure it’s a really awesome battle.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>So this is awkward. I literally just finished a section in which I said that the acting in this film 
		 was wholly unremarkable and I felt that it was forgone for the sake of more fighting. It’s awkward because 
		 the thing that I’m going to have all my wonderful readers look out for is a performance. Ryan Gage who plays 
		 Alfrid does a wonderful job as a completely reprehensible character and also as a comedic respite in a 
		 film that is hurting for laughs. For the Shakespearean aficionados out there, you might recognize this 
		 trick from the Bard himself - if you have a play (or a movie) that’s really heavy, it’s nice to have one 
		 guy to provide a touch of comic relief and give the audience a chance to catch it’s breath before an elf 
		 lord starts running over orcs with his pet elk. Alrid doesn’t have an arc, he starts horrible and ends worse, 
		 but Gage commits to the character and shows his talent by finding places in which to draw out some laughs.</P>
