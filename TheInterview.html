	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>The Interview</u></h1>
		 <p>For right now, forget that “The Interview” almost started World War III, lets just focus on the film. 
		 Seth Rogan (who co-wrote and co-directed the film) and James Franco are better together than I have ever 
		 seen them, their friendship and chemistry is apparent throughout and they keep the film funny no matter 
		 what the subject matter. From the start, you have to understand that you’re going into a Rogan/Franco 
		 film - this the team that brought you “This Is The End” and “Pineapple Express” - it would be a little 
		 unrealistic to expect Shakespeare this time around. With that in mind, knowing that you’re going to get 
		 some of the patented silliness that makes these two both funny and endearing, this is the best film that 
		 I think they could have made on this subject. The plot is silly, but it makes sense; there are no glaringly 
		 idiotic holes in it. Kim Jong Un is even funny, played wonderfully by Randall Park as a cute, insecure, 
		 bumbling dictator who is worried about filling his mean father’ shoes. Lizzy Caplan is in there to make 
		 things awesome because that’s what she does, and in the end I got to watch Kim Jong Un die (spoiler alert) - 
		 if that’s not worth fourteen dollars, I don’t know what is. Now you just have to find a theater near you 
		 that’s playing the fucking thing.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>Yes, this is James Franco and Seth Rogan, but this is them at the top of their game. I’ve seen their 
		 past offerings, and it seemed that they all seem to deteriorate into an inside joke that everyone onscreen 
		 gets and everyone in the audience (who aren’t as high as the people onscreen) is trying to understand. 
		 Thankfully, “The Interview” avoids that trap and delivers a film that is funny from start to finish, makes 
		 sense the whole way through and is a downright good time to watch. I don’t think that Seth Rogan (who came 
		 up with the story for the film) had an international conflict in mind when he thought a movie where he and 
		 James Franco go kill Kim Jong Un, I would bet that he was high as a kite and it seemed funny. It is funny. 
		 It’s also more than that, in the midst of a funny movie, the filmmakers were able to talk candidly about 
		 the evil that is Kim Jong Un.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>I have a huge crush on Lizzy Caplan - I have had since “Party Down”, and she is amazing in this movie. 
		 She’s funny and beautiful and smart and plays very naturally when the script calls on her to be the straight 
		 woman. Even with all that, it was James Franco who blew me away. Franco plays Dave Skylark, a stupid, bright-eyed, 
		 entertainment talk show host who dresses like a peacock. Skylark is vapid, selfish and stupid, but the character 
		 that Franco creates is so funny that is impossible to take your eyes off him when he’s on screen. There is no 
		 wink to the camera from Franco, he plays the character honestly and uses his considerable acting chops to humanize 
		 the character and draw the audience in, while still being absolutely hilarious. Funny, endearing, goofy, stupid 
		 and pretentious, Dave Skylark might be one of my favorite characters in 2014, and easily my favorite James Franco 
		 performance of all time.</P>

		<h3>Impact</h3>
		 <p>It’s hard to find a ticket to Seth Rogan’s new politically-tinted new comedy, “The Interview”. This isn’t because 
		 it’s sold out, but because only a handful of theaters in the country are showing the film after terrorist threats were 
		 made against any theater that screened the movie, in which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is depicted in a particularly 
		 negative light (not that he’s a peach in real life). This movie almost started a war - that is not an exaggeration - 
		 North Korea said that releasing this movie would be an act of war. Then President Barack Obama got on TV and said that 
		 the USA doesn’t negotiate with terrorist, and that this country would respond. A day later, North Korea had no internet 
		 at all. All of that happened because of a Seth Rogan movie. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Even as a comedy (which is what this movie is, a COMEDY), there’s no mistaking that this film is making a statement. 
		It may not be making a declaration of war, as the North Korean’s said, but it’s definitely attacking Kim Jong Un. With 
		a funny conceit and strong script, this film is able to be both a comedy and a film with an obvious political message. 
		It was this very balance of funny and pointed (a balance that “The Daily Show” and “The Colbert Report” have perfected) 
		that makes “The Interview” a success. Going in, I will say that I was worried about the film getting bogged down in stoner 
		and dick jokes, and while those were in there, I was surprised by how much heart and message was in there too. There is a 
		terrible man in power in North Korea, he abuses his power, he starves and enslaves his people, and he has nuclear weapons - 
		if it takes a Seth Rogan movie for the American public to start taking note of that, then thank God for “The Interview”.</P>
