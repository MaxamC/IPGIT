	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Kingsman: The Secret Service</u></h1> 
		 <p>This week I’m taking a closer look at “Kingsmen: The Secret Service”. The film, based on a graphic novel by 
		 Mark Miller and Dave Gibbons and directed by Matthew Vaughn, follows the story of a super secret spy ring. This 
		 is not to say that this film is a spitting image of it’s predecessors, in fact, “Kingsmen” is the spy movie for this generation.</br>
There are two major categories of spy films (at least spy films that make it to AMC theaters): one is American (“Mission Impossible”, “Bourne Identity”) 
and the other is British (“007”). From a movie making point of view, they have similar structures but different tropes, and “Kingsmen”
 throws it’s lot in with the Brits , and does so in style. Below, I explain why its close to the British mold, and where it strays. </br>FYI, NO SPOILER INFO.</br></br>
First- While the Americans often run around in leather jackets and jeans, James Bond has been the sexiest thing in a suit since Sean Connery first
 told us his name. “Kingsmen” is firmly in the British corner on this one, proclaiming, “The suit is the modern gentlemen’s armor.” </br></br>
Second- American spies like Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt are often working outside of the law, usually fighting back against a corrupt government 
agency, the Brits are usually working with MI6 to go after an international baddie who is going to end the world. So it is with “Kingsmen”, with 
one important twist (and here we begin to see the movie turn from the roadmap of Bond films)- these spies are doing all their spying without the
 backing of any government, but instead with the massive combined wealth of it’s establishing members (all information you are given early in the film).</br></br>
Third- and very importantly, this is, again, the spy movie for the new generation and makes a clear effort to connect with us kids. Born from a graphic
 novel, this film reflects the ideas and feelings of a younger generation. The antagonist (played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson) is a tech mogul, 
 who gives the gift of free internet to the world as a way to gain access to everyone’s cell phone. With stories about NSA wiretapping and Lenovo 
 being caught implanting spyware into some of their computers, this a bad guy for Generation Y. “Kingsmen” gives us a spy organization that will 
 not get bogged down in the political square dance that the world has been watching super powers do for years, and as art reflects life, we now 
 have spies that act not for Queen and country, but because it’s the right thing to do, regardless of nationality or politics.</br></br>
So the stage is set, we have a tech-mogul-bad-guy on one side, and a group of dapper, unaffiliated spies on the other (Colin Firth is good as ever
 and newcomer Adrian Quinton is a delight). Using all the suits and gadgets and fancy dresses that the world has come to adore about Bond films, 
 mixed in with a healthy helping of the brash, youthful, American exuberance that audiences love about the “Mission: Impossible” series, “Kingsmen”
 is going to be fun for everyone, but it was made for the younger generation. Finally, after a boatload of comparisons to the spy films that have 
 come before it, perhaps the best way to describe “Kingsmen: The Secret Service” is “007” meets “21 Jump Street”, and it’s definitely worth the 
 time spent (the end of this sentence was cut off when I received it, not sure what you wrote). Now with, hopefully, a little more perspective 
 and insight, let us know what you think of Kingsmen after you see it this weekend.</P>
