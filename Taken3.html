	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Taken 3</u></h1>
		 <p>I remember how much I loved “Taken”, a badass character-driven film with plenty of fight scenes and a story that was easy to follow - pitting a father with “a very particular set of skills” against a bunch of baddies trying to turn his virgin daughter into a sex slave. Fast forward six years to “Taken 3”, directed by Oliver Megaton, and this movie is everything the first one wasn’t. It’s slow, parts of it don’t make any sense, and even Liam Neeson is flat and unconvincing as the hero. The audience is left watching as what I hope is the last installment of a beleaguered franchise limps into the grave.	If you’re a fervent “Taken” fan, then you’ve probably already seen this one, and you probably came to the same conclusion that I did. If you haven’t seen it yet, and you were hoping for more of the action and pace that made “Taken” such an awesome ride, maybe skip the theater and try to find a Redbox that is still renting the original.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>“Taken 3”, set in Los Angeles, centers around Liam Neeson being framed for the murder of his wife, and his quest to clear his name and bring his wife’s murderer to justice. If that sounds more like a run-of-the-mill action movie, then you’re starting to understand some of the fundamental reasons that this film didn’t work out. None of the “father-with-nothing-to-lose” here, maybe six years of playing golf has softened this character up. The entire film boils to a “whodunit” that is wholly under impressive at the conclusion.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>It’s unfair to say that “Taken 3” should be written off completely, Forest Whitaker turns in a strong performance, even though his character doesn’t have much to do. Whitaker (who plays the cop trying to track Neeson down) gives the movie a bit of gravitas and his performance was the most successful part of the film.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>“Taken 3” fails because it just doesn’t make much sense, and doesn’t seem to fit into the franchise (a feat even the forgettable second film was able to do). If you’re curious what I mean by “doesn’t make sense”, let me explain: 1. When he finds his wife dead, she looks like she’s sleeping. Later, we learn that her throat was slit, but there was absolutely no blood on the scene. 2. When he escapes the police through a magical, mystery trapdoor to the sewer, I was VERY curious how he knew that was there. 3. At the height of act 2, before the final chase of the bad guy, Neeson shoots a man twice in the chest and he doesn’t bleed at all. He has an entire conversation, but he does not bleed. Things like this (that would be overlooked in a strong film) ended up being the rope that hanged “Taken 3”.</P>
