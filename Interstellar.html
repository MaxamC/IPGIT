	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Interstellar</u></h1>
		 <p>I got to the theater just after the trailers started to watch “Interstellar” over the 
weekend. Everyone in the theater was on a date and I was the lonely guy who didn’t get the 
memo. I sat in the lone empty seat between two couples, and watched two different actors 
who have since passed away in trailers for films that still have yet to come out. There was a 
distinct feeling of time travel as I watched Paul Walker drive again in the trailer for 
“Furious 7” and heard Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s singular, grating voice in the newest 
“Hunger Games” trailer. It turns out that both my solo appearance and my feeling of time 
travel would be perfect pairings with “Interstellar”, a film that dealt with each of those 
topics. In a futuristic world that looks like the 1980’s, food has run out and our world of 7 
billion people has collapsed under it’s own weight. Humans are now all farmers and very 
wary of spending money on technology that brought about this collapse. In keeping with 
the rest of the film, there wasn't a lot of explanation about where we were or how we got 
there, but through well placed dialogue and a strong story, the audience is never left 
behind. The story moves along nicely, omitting a lot of typical “space movie” scenes that 
we’ve all seen before. By the end of the film, I had laughed and cried (honestly) but I wasn’t 
left with a clear feeling or message. Because of this, I think “Interstellar” is a strong film, 
that is a lot of fun to watch and that ultimately misses and fails to drive home a unifying 
message, leaving the audience wanting an ending that matches the epic nature of the film.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>Science fiction and adventure fans are going to get all they hoped for out of 
“Interstellar”. The nearly three hour epic by Christopher Nolan (The Batman Trilogy) is 
complete with explosions, worm holes, and time travel. That said, the Nolan brothers have 
crafted a script that has more emotional pay-dirt than an “Armageddon” or “Deep Impact”. 
“Interstellar” skates right on the edge between an adventure and a drama. The all-star cast 
and strong performances all around go a long way in keeping the audience involved and 
caring about the characters and their fate. But with large CGI action sequences and a 
subject like space exploration, it’s almost impossible to make a film that isn’t, at it’s core, an 
adventure. The Nolan brother’s assume a very intelligent audience, often having their 
characters talk about quantum mechanics or physics in ways that are far beyond the scope 
of casual understanding. However, instead of taking you out of the story (though, 
sometimes I didn’t quite understand the disaster that was threatening the ship), the 
science-speak and constant use of jargon add to the seriousness of the characters; these 
really seem like people that would be sent into space, not a group of pretty actors that can 
barely say “nuclear”.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>In a film where even smaller, supporting roles were being played by big-name 
actors (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck both play very small, while quite interesting roles), 
it’s hard to pick out one performance to highlight and place above the others. That said, I 
will do exactly that right now (it’s my job). Mackenzie Foy, the 14 year-old who plays 
Mathew McConaughey’s daughter (the role is played beautifully by Jessica Chastain as the 
movie progresses), absolutely steals the show. The role is demanding, requiring a large 
emotional range and Ms. Foy delivers a believable, subtle performance made all the more 
impressive considering that she hasn’t been to prom yet. It may be unfair to hold one 
performance above others simply because of age, but this role is perhaps the most 
important in terms of setting up the emotional payoff the film, as well as a reason for the 
audience to be invested in McConaughey’s journey and his quest to get back to his family. A 
role that sits, maybe unceremoniously, at the intersection of all that is an important one, 
and Ms. Foy is a pleasure to watch perform.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>The sound mixing in “Interstellar” was some of the most interesting I’ve heard in a 
long time. I’m sure that there have been films that have done more groundbreaking things 
with sound or with recreating noises that are completely new, and I don’t mean to slight 
those films. Simply, sound (or the lack of it), was a character in this film in a way I haven’t 
experienced before. Much like David Lean used the desert as a character in “Lawrence of 
Arabia”, Nolan uses space, and it’s complete silence, as an omnipresent force throughout 
the story. Pairing the deafening din of takeoff with an absolute vacuum of sound once the 
crew has made its way into the atmosphere drove home the idea that these people were 
totally alone. In a medium like film, that relies so much on sound, Nolan uses the absence of 
it to express the scariness and expanse of space. One of the biggest potential pitfalls of this 
project was how to make the idea of being lost and alone forever in space be a fear that is 
relatable to a movie theater full of people. Silence, in all of its heavy presence, lent a 
gravitas to situations that a score could not possibly have achieved.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>The “Takeoff” scene in this film was the highlight of the film for me. Nolan attaches a 
camera to the side of McConaughey’s truck as he drives away from his farm and his family 
leaving behind a trail of dust. While he is driving away, it’s possible to hear the familiar 
sound of a countdown and the shot of the truck is merged with an exterior shot of the 
rocket taking off, leaving behind a trail of flame and smoke. By relating the leaving of 
MaConaughey’s family to the launch, Nolan is able to let the audience feel the emotions that 
are being felt by the characters. The idea of leaving everything behind is maybe too much 
for an audience to be able to digest and relate to, but watching a young girl break down in 
tears as her father drives away for what could be the last time is the exact type of small, 
human moment that Nolan uses to bring the audience to an understanding of the type of 
loss that the characters are going through. It’s also a beautiful use of time and story telling, 
no unnecessary scenes of training, or other space movie staples that we have seen so many 
times, simply driving away and then launching. Simple, beautiful and resonating, this scene 
is the high point for the entire film.</P>
