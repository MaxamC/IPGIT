	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Penguins of Madagascar</u></h1>
		 <p>You get exactly what you pay for with “Penguins of Madagascar” - cute penguins 
being commandos and saying funny things. Co-directors Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith 
keep this Thanksgiving family comedy right where it needs to be, cartoony and fun, and the 
result is a very watchable movie that really is fun for the whole family. This isn’t the same 
type of feature as “Wall E” or “Tangled”, where an animated movie told a real story and 
created real drama. “Penguins” is a small, silly film that sets out to simply entertain and it 
more than hits it’s mark - it gets four tiny penguins to demolish it.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>“Penguins of Madagascar” is less an animated film, and more a cartoon. Its plot is
obvious and safe and it doesn’t matter. It’s awesome in its silliness and cuteness and 
simplicity. It has the same dramatic tension as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but isn't that exactly 
why I bought the ticket? I paid $14 in exchange for two hours of mindless entertainment - 
and “Penguins” delivers.</P>
		 
		</div>
        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>None of the heavies from the “Madagascar” series come back to play with their polar 
pals, but this leaves room for John Malkovich to give his voice to a huge octopus. I know 
that a lot of you think I just described the plot of “The Little Mermaid”, but I did not. John 
Malkovich plays the voice of an evil, purple, bucktoothed (octopi have mouths where we do 
in cartoon-land) octopus in “Penguins” and it’s amazing. Malkovich has played so many 
memorable characters and mastered so many voices (who can forget Teddy KGB in 
“Rounders”?) and he slips easily into the world of animation. The voice acting from the four 
penguins is so strong that it would be easy to be forgettable (Benedict Cumberbatch proves 
this with his performance as a wolf) but Malkovich rises to the occasion and more - he’s 
just plain funny.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>“Penguins of Madagascar” doesn’t bite off more than it can chew - granted it barely 
nibbles, but just like the TV show that is so successful, “Penguins” doesn’t try to be more 
than it is. The fact that no one aspect stood out against the others is a testament to how 
well the film worked as a whole, and points to why it was such a success. Eric Darnell and 
Simon J. Smith offer little more than a drawn-out episode of the cartoon, and by staying in 
that sweet spot the movie flourishes. I can barely remember the plot, but it doesn’t matter 
because I went to see four tiny penguins cause mischief and be adorable and say funny 
things. They did, they were, and they do.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Not too many hidden bits of treasure in this one, but definitely keep your ears open 
for names of celebrities being mixed into the dialogue (e.g. “Helen! Hunt them down!”). This 
little wink at the parents in the audience is exactly the type of humor that makes “Penguins 
of Madagascar” such a home run..</P>
