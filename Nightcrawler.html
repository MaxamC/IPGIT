		 <p>I was a little late to the “Nightcrawler” party. Almost a month late, in fact (the Dan 
Gilroy thriller was released on Halloween). But I wasn’t a film critic back then (how’s THAT 
for instilling confidence in my readers?), so I had to watch it now. Late or not, the film was a 
tight story centered around the most interesting performance I’ve seen this year. It may not 
be exactly what you thought it was going to be after seeing the trailer, but in a Hollywood 
littered with trailers that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination, it’s nice to be 
surprised. This is the directorial debut for Dan Gilroy who is a prominent screenwriter 
(“Reel Steel” and “The Bourne Legacy”) and he delivers. Bolstered by powerhouse 
performances, “Nightcrawler” is a creepy thriller that will have you thinking and discussing 
long after you’ve left the theater.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>“Nightcrawler” is like a lot of its contemporaries in that it doesn’t adhere to one 
specific genre. A mix of crime, drama and thriller, this quick-paced film delivers a very 
concise and well told story standing in the shadow of such a brilliant performance that the 
audience gets swept up in the wants and needs of a sociopath. It is not a big story, don’t 
expect sweeping twists or huge emotional payoffs, that’s not what Dan Gilroy (who wrote 
and directed the film) had in mind for this feature. It’s a tight, succinct story about one man 
and a couple of the choices he makes and how those choices affect the people only around 
him. There is no world to save, no damsel in distress, no clock to beat. There are car chases 
and guns and bullet holes and a level of placid violence that is chilling, but the scope 
remains small and the result is a well delivered film with a message about the current level 
of acceptance that our society has for gratuitous violence on TV and a performance from 
Gyllenhaal that is worth seeing in and of itself.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>It’s worth seeing “Nightcrawler” simply for Gyllenhaal. He’s on screen for almost 
every minute and there is a strong case to be made that the entire film is little more than a 
character study. And what a character! Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a man who will stop 
at nothing to find what he calls, “a career he can grow into”. Gyllenhaal acts with an 
intensity that is palpable while remaining distant and disconnected from the world around 
him. With the same intense stare that is so blood-chilling on serial killers, Gyllenhaal talks 
about everything from wanting a job and being a quick learner, to cooly and calmly 
blackmailing women into having sex with him. After all of this, after all the inhuman things 
that we see him do, after he callously films the dead and dying without lifting a finger to 
help, after all of that, I still cared about him and want him to succeed. It’s here that 
Gyllenhaal finds the true magic of this performance. We have seen anti-hero’s before, from 
“Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid” to “Ocean’s 11”, the idea of rooting for characters that 
are on the wrong side of the law is nothing new. In “Nightcrawler” Gyllenhaal and Gilroy 
take that one step further and ask the audience to care about a man who’s not necessarily a 
criminal, but could be something much worse. It worked for me, and gave the film a 
dynamic feeling that helped it pay off come end credits.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>During the opening credits, Gilroy introduces two characters that star in the film 
and that you won’t be able to find on IMDB - nighttime, and the city of Los Angeles. I talked 
about Christopher Nolan using space as a character in “Interstellar”, and I saw it again in 
“Nightcrawler”. Nighttime, in Los Angeles, inside cars - these are characters that are living 
in their own world. A world where trafficking on human suffering is okay so long as the 
viewers come in droves. This is the crux of the film, the theme if you will. “Nightcrawler” 
holds a mirror up to a culture that is obsessed with audience and doesn’t care about trivial 
things like decency toward human life, respect of privacy or even telling a true story. These 
people are driven by results and they are going to get them. What better place to grow a 
character that is willing to succeed at all costs? What better place to see him blossom into a 
more unique and horrifying type of evil?</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Usually, when given a piece of Hollywood Hunk like Jake Gyllenhaal, the wardrobe
department makes him look good enough to eat, whether or not it fits the character on 
screen. Sex sells and Hollywood knows that, but in this film, Gyllenhaal is on screen 
wearing baggy button downs that look like hand-me-downs, his hair is greasy and a grimy 
windbreaker clings to him for the duration of the film. It was because of this wardrobe that 
when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a film set in the 1980’s. This small choice 
informs so much of the character. Here is a man who knows what the corporate “uniform” 
is, but has no idea that he is not recreating it because he has no sense of “style”. He also 
doesn’t realize that giving career advice while standing over a dead human being is callous 
and he will never understand why women dismiss his advances as he talks about sex like a 
business transaction. This is a man disconnected with the world, and the audience is shown 
that clearly in the way he presents himself onscreen.</P>
