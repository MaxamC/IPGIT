	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Whiplash</u></h1>
		 <p>Fast paced and exciting, “Whiplash” had my attention from the start, and refused to let it go. The film, nominated for Best Picture, follows Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller), a promising young drummer at the prestigious Shaffer School of Music in Manhattan. Young, friendless, and scared, Teller is found by the school’s all-powerful studio band conductor, played by JK Simmons. Simmons plucks the young man from his first-year classroom and graduates him to the “big leagues”, but at the price of being his new whipping boy. Chairs go flying, the air is filled with insults, and Simmons is just getting warmed up. Smart and controlled, the film keeps a small scope that enables it to have depth that was appreciated. Beautifully acted and shot with purpose and an artistic eye, “Whiplash” is a clap-in-the-theater type of film.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>Moviegoers who are familiar with the “prodigy at a conservatory” story will feel right at home with “Whiplash”. Films like “Center Stage” (2000) and “Varsity Blues” (1999) have similar tropes, the overbearing teacher, the lack of understanding from the family of the student - all of these are found in “Whiplash” as well. It’s the work of JK Simmons that keeps this from turning into, “just another one of those movies.” Simmons is a mixture of mean and magnanimous that explains why students love and respect him in the first place. Switching from understanding and friendly to cruel and manipulating, it’s easy for an audience to see how this man could easily manipulate and torture the young musicians he is put in charge of.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>With an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actor, JK Simmons has drawn everyone’s attention for the work he did in this film. Playing the abusive band leader, he drives Teller nearly to destruction in a never-ending quest to, “find the next Charlie Parker.” The role of a mean teacher has been done before, overbearing and unchanged the destruction of his ways, these characters are usually impossible to relate to and end up as evil archetypes that serve a purpose in the story, but fail to draw the audience in. Simmons brings comedy into the film, berating his band with delightfully horrible spouts of curses and insults. At one point he shouts, “You give a calculator to a retard, he’s gonna try to turn on the TV with it!” It’s just this mix of cruelty and dark humor that makes Simmons’ character so devious, and so much fun to watch. Simmons gives life to the role - he’s funny and charming when he’s not torturing his students, and it’s this ability to be both friend and foe that makes his portrayal all the more villainous.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>This film has a score of triumphs - there’s a reason it’s on the list of Best Picture nominees - but there was one thing that I thought stood out above all else, and that was this film’s ability to visualize music. A combination of beautiful cinematography (Sharone Meir, who was not nominated) and editing (Tom Cross who is nominated for Best Editing), this film was able to make listening to music a visually enticing experience. Quick cuts, a beautiful color palette of golds and dark chocolate browns, and a lovely exhibition of the instruments themselves all led to a film that was just as much fun to watch as it was to listen to. With all the successes of this film, I think it was these pieces that were the most important because of the role that music plays in the film. So much of the film is musicians playing music, and if it had been boring to watch, the whole film would have suffered dramatically.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Miles Teller isn’t doing all the drumming that you hear on the soundtrack of the film, but he LOOKS like he is, and that’s worth something. This isn’t an actor sitting behind a piano, where you can hide their hands, “Whiplash” has Teller playing some of the most complex jazz songs in the world, and he’s on screen the whole times he’s doing it. Teller, who has been playing drums since he was a boy, had to learn the Jazz playing technique, and learned to play the songs that are in the film so that the camera wouldn’t be able to notice the difference. This little bit of filmmaking, this extra work by an actor, made the entire movie work. Without Teller on the kit, without his sticks flying and his bloody hands and sweat-covered face right behind those drums for the audience to see, this movie isn’t the tremendous victory that it turned out to be.</P>
