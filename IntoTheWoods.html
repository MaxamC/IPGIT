	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Into The Woods</u></h1>
		 <p>It took less than a minute for two things to become clear to me when I was watching 
		 “Into The Woods”: this was a film that was adapted from the stage and this was a Steven Sondheim 
		 musical. When you add in the cast that this movie carries, it has all the trappings for a huge success - 
		 unfortunately, the quick, catchy lyrics and the star power didn’t help the fact that it was very long 
		 (and felt very long) and felt like a play. There had been some changes to the story since Sondheim 
		 first brought this play to Broadway, but the bones of it are still there - a mishmash of Grimm fairytales 
		 that are interconnected and modernized to play as one cohesive story. Whatever changes were made were not 
		 enough, the film was still long and felt like it needed an intermission half way through. The songs were 
		 well sung, but there were no moments like Anne Hathaway’s powerhouse “I Dreamed A Dream” from “Les Miserables”.
		 Finally, “Into The Woods” is fun at first, but misses. It has a lot of fun, there are strong performances, 
		 but it takes too long and leaves the audience ready to go home as opposed to wanting more.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>Fans of the musical are going to feel right at home while watching “Into The Woods”. Coming from Sondheim, 
		 this is no accident - the man practically invented the genre and there is no one doing it better. Sondheim did 
		 not write the screenplay, that job was done by James Lapine with Rob Marshall directing, and they lead the film 
		 very dutifully down a path that Sondheim has clearly marked. “Into The Woods” has the classic, Broadway, musical 
		 feel that musical fans will love, but that isn’t enough to offset the fact that it’s long and doesn’t leave the 
		 audience with any particular feeling or message.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>Emily Blunt is so far out in front of her peers during this film that it’s like watching Michael Phelps swim 
		 in a YMCA swim-meet. This is saying something, as she shares screen time with Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick and James 
		 Corden - all of whom are favorites of mine and deliver strong performances in their own right (especially Kendrick, 
		 whose feminist Cinderella is electric). Onscreen, Blunt is transfixing. She sings beautifully and maintains a powerful, 
		 optimistic presence on screen that is hard to look away from. Her character is a complex one, and Blunt informs the role 
		 with choices that are understandable and human. From funny, to passionate, to confused and ultimately undone by her 
		 own actions, Blunt is nothing but glorious and her performance was the best part of the film, far and away.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>When watching this film, it was impossible for me to not see how the filmmakers had adapted it from the stage. 
		 It’s a long film (over 2 hours) and a movie-goer who has spent some time watching plays might notice, as I did, that 
		 there was a need for an intermission. This isn’t because it’s too long, but instead because the film hits a high point 
		 about half way through that would (on stage) have led into intermission. Coming back from intermission, the audience 
		 would have fresh eyes to start the second act on the slow note that it does. In a movie theater however, it’s just a 
		 lag in the momentum of the film. As they acts change, the audience stays, and the beginning of the second act drags 
		 out, setting up for the conclusion that, when it finally comes, doesn’t deliver like it should. “Into The Woods” is 
		 bolstered by the marvelous story that Sondheim created for it, but it is dragged down by the attempt to stay true to 
		 that story, even in adaptation.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>Look out for Johnny Depp’s wolf to be super creepy and give off a distinct child molester feel. This character, 
		 and the song he sings, were both part of the original Broadway production and the scene was a problem for Disney from 
		 the start, and I can see why. Depp sings about eating young Little Red Riding Hood in such a carnal, sexual way that 
		 it’s impossible to think that this wolf has anything else on his mind but sex. “Into The Woods” is full of bits like 
		 this, where the fanciful, childhood tellings of Grimm fairytales are thrown out in favor of harsher, honest dangers 
		 that lurk in our very real world. Sometimes it can be a lot of fun, but others, like the wolf - are a bit creepy.</P>
