	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Hunger Games: Mockingjay</u></h1>
		 <p>First and foremost, it’s important to know that I have not read the books. I bring this up 
because I’m looking at “Hunger Games: Mockingjay” Part 1 as film number three out of a 
four-part series. As a film, it is a lot of fun - easily the high point of the series so far. There 
are a few moments that ask the audience to suspend disbelief (for more, read the “What To 
Watch For” section) but the filmmaking is breathtaking, the characters are dynamic and the 
drama is real. One scene reminded me a lot of Richard Attenborough’s “Gandhi” where 
rebels are running headlong into enemy fire. Scenes like this gave “Mockingjay” a gravitas 
that had been lacking in the previous films - in this third installment, I finally found myself 
caring about the characters. While no series will ever come close to the perfection that is 
“Harry Potter”, this offering by Francis Lawrence does a great job at washing the taste of 
“Twilight” out of my mouth and giving me a genuine interest in the fourth and final 
installment.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>This installment of the Hunger Games franchise is easily the most rewarding film of the 
series. Francis Lawrence is back in the director’s chair (he also directed “Catching Fire”) 
and is able to create a world that is so much more than a fight between a bunch of 
teenagers. The huge battle that was the epicenter of the first two films is missing in this one 
and without it we are left with a movie that is able to tell human stories that I was able to 
relate to and care about. I would wager that this film will be the best received by lovers of 
the book because it is able to give time to the nuance and relationships that are often 
glossed over in order to get to the action. It is these relationships and these moments that 
draw the audience into the story, which is why this film is easily the best of the series so 
far. Fans of the first two movies shouldn’t be alarmed, this is still a “Hunger Games" movie, 
there is no escaping that, but this film focuses more on the people and less on the battle and 
that makes it a success.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>Jennifer Lawrence is the real deal; every mother-freeking ounce of it. The 24 year old
actress already has an Oscar of her own and two more nominations and in “Mockingjay 
Part 1” she shows exactly why. Surrounded by heavy hitters like Julianne Moore and the 
late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who is also astounding, and to whom the film is lovingly 
dedicated to) she rises above and outshines anyone else on the screen. Other actors come 
off campy & silly, unable to bring any substance into their “young-adult-novel” characters, 
but Lawrence hooks the audience and takes us into the head of a young revolutionary in a 
way that is sure to please book loyalists and movie fans alike. She brings an amount of truth 
to her roles that is inescapable for the audience. I am constantly left in awe of her talent 
and the amount of honesty in emotion that she is able to portray on screen again and again; 
be it a con man’s wife, a dance partner for a mentally unstable man, or a bow-toting 
revolutionary, Jennifer Lawrence is a wonder to behold.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>Scope. That’s the word that comes to mind as I recall the cinematic qualities of Francis 
Lawrence’s “Mockingjay”. From the start, establishing shots of the underground bunker 
that is District 13 are huge, and there is very little obvious CGI to ruin it. From the 
massiveness of the 13 to the expanse of the devastation of 12, the audience is able to feel 
the power of situations simply by being shown. The huge scale of the shots lent a 
seriousness to the uprising, and counteracted the personal nature the dialogue and the 
character development. Whether it was flying over expansive forests or the sabotaging of a 
dam, the scope of the film was enormous and incredibly exciting to watch, while the story 
was able to remain small enough and personal enough so that the audience cared.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>*SPOILER ALERT* The following is going to spoil some of the movie for you. So if you like 
your movies like you like your milk - keep on walking…reading. No, don’t read! But you 
know - move it along.</p>
<p>I try not to nitpick. I’ve never made a feature film, I have no idea how hard it would be to 
get every little thing right. That said, there were three moments in “Mockingjay” where the 
audience was asked to not only suspend disbelief, but crinkle it up and throw it out the 
window. The scene in which Jennifer Lawrence goes back to District 12 for the first time, 
everything is still smoking. Nothing is on fire, it’s presumably been a little bit since the 
bombs fell, why is there smoke? The shot of the firebombing aftermath is smokeless and 
harrowing - another example of scope in the filmmaking that I thought was used 
beautifully. But the smoke when she lands is just so silly. It makes no sense, but it looks 
good, so that’s why it’s in the movie. Alright, so the whole bombing raid scene made no 
logical sense to me. From the fact that the bomb shelter, that is forty stories underground is 
shaking from strikes at the surface, to the premise that they would ever lock Katniss on the 
other side of those doors, and finally the water. I can hear you asking, what water? In the 
scene where everyone is stampeding down the stairs to the shelter and then Katniss goes 
back up to find Prim, there is water pouring down the stairwell. I don’t know why there is 
so much water pouring into the stairwell, I’m thinking this is much the same as the smoke 
in district 12, it’s just there to look good. My problem isn’t where it came from, though. My 
problem is where it goes. When they open the doors to bring Katniss up to the surface to 
make another video, the steps are banged up, but bone dry. Where did all that water go? I 
know this detail is asinine and I’m kind of an ass for bringing it up, but I would like an 
explanation. In my opinion they should have been swimming up that stairwell. This is a 
small one, and as silly as it may seem, mistakes like this can really take me out of a story. 
After a field hospital they visit gets attacked by the Capitol, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and 
Katniss get separated from their team when a huge smoke stack falls onto the building 
they’re hiding in. Then Katniss shoots an arrow at an airplane and destroys it and it’s 
wingman (that’s actually not the unbelievable part). In the next scene, we see that the 
footage of Katniss shooting the plane down is in the propaganda film. The only problem is 
that the audience just saw that Katniss and Gale were alone when she shot that arrow - 
there was a one hundred foot tall big pillar falling through a building to establish this fact - 
and if that is true, where did they get that footage from? The mystery camera? Again, really 
cool visual, but it just doesn’t pass the logic test. Are these all silly? Yes? Do they take away 
from the film? If your mind works like mine does, then yes, for a second they do. But this is 
a good movie, and little hiccups like this can’t slow it down.</P>
