	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>50 Shades of Grey</u></h1>
		 <p>There is one positive thing to pull out of “50 Shades Of Grey”: we now know for sure that watching movie stars having sex can be boring. In fact, the whole movie was boring, a helicopter ride was boring, a flight in a glider was boring, a drive in his Audi A8 was boring (there was a lot of different, expensive types of travel in this film). Based on the best selling book by E. L. James, the movie centers around the “chemistry” between big-eyed Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and monotone Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). She is a recent college graduate and before meeting Mr. Grey, a virgin. He is a brooding, young billionaire who likes to handcuff people to the bed. While they are infatuated with each other, neither wants to be what the other one wants them to be. That is the entire dramatic premise of the film, and as you might imagine, two hours of watching a woman decide if she wants to be in a relationship or not is not the classic definition of quality cinema. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson does her best to make a movie out of a romance novel, but there simply isn’t enough story here, and the sex is boring to boot.</P>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>The film received an R rating, and the book was called pornography more than once, but when I went to see it, I was struck by the tameness of the whole thing; there are more shocking images in “Selma” where protestors are beaten by police officers. “50 Shades Of Grey”  takes us into a world where fetish is possible, where it’s talked about, and where no one is engaging in it (holding someone’s hands above their head is not BDSM). French critics felt the movie was so tame, they rated it as acceptable for 12 year-olds to watch; and considering what’s readily available on the internet, I agree with them. The character of the mythical Christian Grey isn’t even as powerful as other characters that we’ve met who are cut from the same cloth. Pierce Brosnan was about one hundred times sexier and more suave in, “The Thomas Crowne Affair” (1999) than Jamie Dornan is as Mr. Grey (“Crowne” has a far better glider scene as well). For all controversy and build-up, “50 Shades Of Grey” finally offends no one, and when you take the sex out of a porno, it does get very dull.</P>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>I have to give credit where it’s due, and Dakota Johnson deserves it this time. Her performance may be helped by Jamie Dornan being so bland beside her, but Johnson takes a role where this isn’t much on the page, and brings humanity and humor to a film that is starving for both. After starting off with a  dear-in-headlights attitude during her first meeting with Mr. Grey, she finally settles into something that seems like a human being - there was a lot of the breathy, halted flirting that only happens in movies and would make people concerned for your mental health if it took you seven seconds to respond to everything in real life. There is something to be said for the type of bravery it takes to be an actor who spends half of a movie naked and tied up, and Johnson does more than just bite lips and make eyes, she seems to be the only one paddling in this slow-moving life raft of a film.</P>

		<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
		 <p>I was stuck by the imbalance of the sexes in this film. I realize that it’s about a dominant man and a submissive woman, I get all that, and that’s not what I’m talking about. What I’m talking about is nudity and how it was handled regarding the lead actors. Dakota Johnson spends about half the movie with her birthday suit on, getting tied up and tempted with riding crops while Jamie Dornan seems to be married to his jeans. There’s even a section of the movie where Mr. Grey scolds Ms. Steele because he wants her to be proud in her nudity — but he’s gonna go ahead and keep his Levi’s on. At one point she is completely nude, tied to the bed and he’s still strutting around in his jeans. It’s one of many times that fellow audience members and I found ourselves laughing when I don’t think that was the intention.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>This is a movie without a subplot. It’s one of the only movies that I’ve ever seen that doesn’t have one, and it makes for a very boring film. The book was filled with sex scene after sex scene, ties and handcuffs and the whole thing was hot and steamy like good takeout. The film couldn’t include all that sex, and so it was just the story about one girl who takes a really long time figuring out if she wants to whipped or not. I found myself looking for a storyline about halfway through the film, looking for anything that was what I considered an actual story, but beyond an undercooked romance, there is nothing else in the movie that drives plot or increases dramatic tension. It is a wasteland of a relationship that is solely based on sex, and we don’t even get to see the sex. In the ultimate twist, “50 Shades Of Grey” is the biggest dry-hump in the cinema this season.</P>
