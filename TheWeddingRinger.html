	  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>The Wedding Ringer</u></h1>
		 <p>The idea behind Jeremy Garelick’s “The Wedding Ringer” is a good one, but beyond being a good idea, the film doesn’t accomplish much. It’s formulaic and slow, with scenes dragging out long after they’ve stopped being funny, if they ever were. While Kevin Hart and Josh Gad have strong chemistry on screen, it doesn’t make up for a script that lags and a story that is so bizarre it’s impossible to believe. There are parts that are a lot of fun; the movie is at it’s best when it surrounds the rag-tag group of conmen posing as a wedding party, and when they are all on screen together “The Wedding Ringer” can be laugh-out-loud funny, but as a whole, it’s doesn’t fulfill it’s promise of being a ‘ringer’.</P>
        <br/>

		 <h3>Genre</h3>
		 <p>“The Wedding Ringer” tries to be half buddy comedy, half wedding movie, but finally ends up being not enough of either. It’s hard to watch this film and not think of, “Wedding Crashers” (2005); another buddy comedy that centers around the idea that conning people during weddings is inherently funny. There are even scenes that you might recognize: a dinner with an old, foul-mouthed grandmother, a game of touch football with the father of the bride that gets too rough. But while “Wedding Crashers” remained heartfelt and hilarious, “The Wedding Ringer” never finds it’s stride and comes off as goofy at best, but mostly boring.</P>

        <div class="iright" style="">
		<h3>Performance</h3>
		 <p>The best parts of this film are when the “groomsmen” are allowed to go off and have fun together. Along with Mr. Hart and Mr. Gad, these actors create the only scenes in the film where I was really enjoying myself. With well-written characters and natural comedic skills, each of these actors brings something unique to the table. As a fan of comedy, I always love seeing a group of people that are allowed to be as silly and out-there as they want, and still have those choices make sense in the film. If the entire movie could have centered around the misadventures of this group, it may have been a success, but the wedding plot was so hard to watch that the whole film suffered.</P>

		<h3>What To Watch For</h3>
		 <p>I found myself asking, “Why?” A lot during this film. Why is a beautiful woman marrying such a loser? The excuse that he is a safe bet with lots of money doesn’t seem to really hold water - they have absolutely nothing in common. Why does Kevin Hart break his own rules and become friends with this guy? What is it about Josh Gad’s character that is so endearing? Questions like this are why this film fails, because they are never answered. They are glossed over, and a couple lines of dialogue here and there try to answer them, but it seems like the prevailing reason is, “just because”. With such an unsteady foundation, it’s no surprise “The Wedding Ringer” was shaky once it tried to get on it’s feet.</P>
